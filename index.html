        Many bacterial species are unknown in the field of microbiology. Undiscovered and undocumented species have the potential to lead to great new discoveries.
        <br><br>
        Through laboratory reasearch a certain bacteria has been discovered with the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like meat. This discovery has lead to teaming up with Improbable Beef, a food start up company looking to discover meat alternatives. 
        <br><br>
        Labs across the country have had success in synthesizing meat from algae, fungi, and microorganisms found on plant roots. But now, Improbable Beef is looking toward the future of this elusive bacteria that could provide the perfect taste for meat alternative. 
        <br><br>
        Scientists believe that this microorganism that can provide that perfect beef taste might be right under our noses, or should I say under our chests. The human body is a source of thousands of types of bacteria and the perfect one could be found right in our belly buttons. To test this hypothesis the navels of people across the country have been sampled to identify the bacterial species that colonize in our belly buttons. The charts below present the results of this study.
